--[[
	This is an example of what every asset file format
	that uses Lua in our class should look like
]]

-- A well-behaved asset (in our class) will:
--	* Be a table
--	* Return itself from a file

return
{
	-- The actual layout and content of the table
	-- can be whatever you decide the best format is
}
